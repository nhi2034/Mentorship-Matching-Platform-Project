## How to install
1. Download the source code by:
- Cloning the repo: git clone [<GitHub link>](https://github.com/nhi2034/Mentorship-Matching-Platform-Project.git) or downloading the ZIP file from GitHub and extracting it
- Open the project folder in VSCode
- Open the index.html file in your browser (double-click it or use Live Server to preview)
- Only the frontend. So , you're using a mock API with JSON-server, run the following commands:
   `npm install` or `npm run start`

##Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Mock API (simulated using plain JavaScript functions)
- Deployed using GitHub.

## Technical Decisions
- Used plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript without any frameworks.
- Created a mock API manually using JavaScript since no real backend was needed.
- Divided the project into separate components such as: -	Auth Page (Login/Register). 
  Next, there will be two separate interfaces â€” one for Mentors and one for Mentees. 
  In each interface, users will have access to the following pages: Match Page, Profile Page, Edit profile Page, Progress Tracker Page.
- Deploy from GitHub.
